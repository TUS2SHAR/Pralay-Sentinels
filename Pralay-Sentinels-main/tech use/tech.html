            <!-- <img src="/what is glof/glof1.jpg" alt="sensors" class="section-image"> -->
            <p class="description">IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, such as radar, ultrasonic, temperature, and seismic sensors, are
                deployed around glacial lakes. These sensors collect real-time data on lake water levels, temperature
                changes, seismic activity, and ground movement, which can be used to detect signs of instability.

                        <p>Temperature sensor:
                            A temperature sensor measures heat and converts it into an electronic signal. Common types include thermocouples, RTDs, and infrared sensors, each suited to different applications. In a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) scenario, temperature sensors can monitor melting rates and water temperatures to predict potential risks, enhancing early warning systems for timely evacuations.</p>

                        <p>seismic sensor
                            A seismic sensor detects ground vibrations caused by natural events like earthquakes, landslides, or rockfalls by measuring ground motion. In the context of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), these sensors are crucial for detecting early signs of potential triggers such as ice movement or landslides. By providing real-time data, seismic sensors enhance early warning systems, helping predict and mitigate GLOF risks, ensuring timely evacuations and disaster response.</p>

                        <p>Peizometer sensor
                            A piezometer sensor measures the pressure of fluids within soil or rocks, often used to monitor groundwater or pore water pressure. In glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) scenarios, piezometers help assess the stability of the lake's natural dam by tracking changes in water pressure beneath or around the glacier. These readings can indicate weakening or potential failure of the dam, allowing for early warnings and preventive actions to minimize the risk of catastrophic flooding.</p>

                        <p>inclinometer sensor
                            An inclinometer sensor measures the angle of slope or tilt, typically used to detect ground movements or shifts in terrain. In the case of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), inclinometers are used to monitor the stability of slopes surrounding glacial lakes and natural dams. By detecting ground deformation or landslides that could lead to dam failure, these sensors provide early warnings of potential GLOF events, enabling timely interventions to reduce flood risks.</p>

                        <p>water level sensor.      
                            A water level sensor measures the height or volume of water in a reservoir or lake. In relation to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), water level sensors are crucial for monitoring rising water levels in glacial lakes. They provide real-time data that can indicate the risk of an overflow or dam breach, enabling early warnings and timely evacuations to mitigate the impact of GLOFs on downstream communities.</p>
